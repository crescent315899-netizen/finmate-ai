# FinMate AI Feature Audit

**Audit date:** 18 October 2026
**Scope:** Source review, local project configuration, prior verified production deployment review, and live fictional-demo navigation check. No production data was changed for this audit.

## Audit basis

- Repository: `main` branch, latest reviewed commit `ede6851` (`Keep fictional demo accessible with cloud auth`).
- Framework: Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, React, Supabase client/SSR, Vitest, and Vercel configuration.
- Package manager: pnpm 11.25.0.
- Verified public URL: https://finmate-ai-iota.vercel.app/
- Source files reviewed include `app/`, `components/dashboard.tsx`, `lib/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `supabase/functions/finance-assistant/`, `next.config.ts`, `vercel.json`, `README.md`, and `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Current local checks: lint passed, TypeScript typecheck passed, Vitest passed **8/8**, and `pnpm build` passed. The previously verified Vercel production deployment was observed as **Ready**; the changes described below have not yet been deployed during this audit.

## Status legend

- **Verified live**: observed on the deployed public site.
- **Implemented and source-reviewed**: behavior exists in reviewed source but this audit did not create or alter real user records to prove it end to end.
- **Configuration-dependent**: requires an account, credentials, or a third-party service configuration.
- **Not tested in this audit**: intentionally not exercised, usually to avoid production data changes or user-account creation.

## Feature-by-feature status

| Area | Status | Evidence and notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Landing page | **Verified live** | Public HTTPS landing page, feature sections, sign-in link, and demo link were previously loaded. Source: `app/page.tsx`. |
| Fictional demo access | **Verified live** | `/app?demo=1` opened a page labelled **FICTIONAL DEMO** and loaded sample finance records. The middleware deliberately permits only this labelled demo without a session. |
| Dashboard overview | **Verified live** | Live demo displayed balance, monthly income, expenses, unpaid bills, cash flow, forecast, category spending, bills, budget pulse, and signals. |
| Transactions UI | **Verified live** | Live demo displayed Add transaction, search, type/category filters, sort control, table rows, and normal edit/delete controls. |
| Budgets UI | **Verified live** | Live demo displayed budget progress and category/month/amount form. |
| Bills UI | **Verified live** | Live demo displayed upcoming and paid bills, Mark paid, Undo payment, and add-bill form. |
| Savings goals UI | **Verified live** | Live demo displayed goals, contribution controls, history, and create-goal form. |
| FinMate AI UI | **Verified live** | Live demo displayed assistant conversation, rules-based welcome, question box, signals, and Draft a budget change. |
| Settings UI | **Verified live** | Live demo displayed currency/timezone controls, forecast settings, categories, demo export, and reset controls. |
| Ledger validation and calculations | **Implemented and source-reviewed** | `lib/schemas.ts`, `lib/finance.ts`, and `tests/finance.test.ts` provide input validation and deterministic integer-minor-unit calculation coverage. |
| Bill payment integrity | **Implemented and source-reviewed** | UI uses Supabase RPCs in cloud mode; SQL migrations link bill payment to one expense, protect linked records, and provide undo. |
| Savings contribution integrity | **Implemented and source-reviewed** | Goal contributions are separate records; owner trigger is in migrations. |
| Activity history | **Implemented and source-reviewed** | The UI creates activity records for meaningful local mutations; cloud mapping and database table are present. |
| Authentication | **Configuration-dependent** | Sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, password-reset UI and Supabase auth client are implemented. The app's configured production auth flow was not exercised with a new test account in this audit. |
| User-specific cloud sync | **Configuration-dependent** | `loadCloudWorkspace` / `syncCloudWorkspace` and prior deployment configuration are present. A two-user runtime isolation test was not performed in this audit. |
| Database schema and RLS | **Implemented and source-reviewed** | Versioned Supabase migrations enable RLS on user-owned tables and define own-row policies, owner guards, grants, indexes, triggers, and RPCs. Migration application was previously reported verified in the connected Supabase project; no database query was run for this documentation pass. |
| Optional AI provider | **Configuration-dependent** | The server-side `/api/assistant` route and `finance-assistant` Edge Function have a safe rules fallback. Generative replies require a server-side provider key. The fallback was observed in the live demo; no provider-key test was performed. |
| PWA manifest and icons | **Implemented; public manifest previously checked** | `app/manifest.ts`, PWA icons, service-worker registration, and `/offline` page are present. Installation was not tested on a physical user device in this audit. |
| Offline behavior | **Implemented and source-reviewed** | `public/sw.js` caches public shell assets and serves `/offline` for failed navigations; it bypasses `/api/` and does not cache authenticated finance API responses. |
| Responsive layout | **Implemented and source-reviewed** | CSS defines desktop sidebar, compact sidebar, and mobile navigation at 680px. A prior viewport inspection was performed; this pass did not run physical-device testing. |
| Public deployment | **Verified live** | The public Vercel HTTPS URL was previously loaded, and the latest `ede6851` deployment was observed Ready. |

## Routes and navigation

| Path | Purpose | Access expectation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Public landing page | Public |
| `/auth` | Sign in, sign up, password reset | Public |
| `/app?demo=1` | Explicit fictional demo | Public, browser-local sample data |
| `/app` | Private workspace | Requires a Supabase session when cloud configuration is present |
| `/offline` | Offline shell | Public |
| `/manifest.webmanifest` | PWA manifest | Public |

Inside the workspace, the section navigation is client-side and URL-synchronised through `?view=`: **Overview**, **Transactions**, **Budgets**, **Bills**, **Savings goals**, **FinMate AI**, **Activity**, and **Settings**. This preserves direct links and expected browser Back/Forward behavior.

## Known limitations and recommended follow-up

1. **End-to-end cloud test remains advisable.** Create two ordinary non-production test accounts, verify that each account can only view and change its own records, and verify sign-up, email confirmation, password reset, sync after refresh, payment/undo, and assistant Edge Function behavior.
2. **Optional AI is not evidence of financial advice.** The rules fallback works without a provider key. Configure a server-side provider key only if generative responses are wanted, and monitor cost/rate limits separately.
3. **No banking integrations.** Users must enter data manually; there is no bank, card, payment, or automatic bill-payment connection.
4. **No custom domain documented.** The verified Vercel domain is the public URL currently recorded here.
5. **PWA device installation should be accepted as browser-dependent.** Manifest/service-worker support is present, but exact install wording varies by browser and operating system.

## Change control for this audit

- Current local source changes improve question-specific assistant fallbacks, bounded conversation context, duplicate-submit protection, URL-synchronised workspace navigation, cloud-session recovery behavior, mobile navigation coverage, and original SVG PWA branding assets.
- Documentation and matching PDFs were added or refreshed. No database migration, Supabase setting, Vercel setting, Git remote, deployment, or production financial data was changed during this audit.
